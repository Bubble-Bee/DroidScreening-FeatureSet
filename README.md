# DroidScreening-FeatureSet and Malware samples.


To mitigate malware threats on mobile platforms (e.g., Android) and engage the research community to better our understanding 
and defense, we are happy to release our Android malware samples to the community. However, to avoid this samples from
being misused, we need to have some sort of authentication to verify user identity or require necessary justification,
instead of making the dataset completely public. For that purpose, if you are interested in getting access to our Android Malware samples,
please send us emails for a request.
